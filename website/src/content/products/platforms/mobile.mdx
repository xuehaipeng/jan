## How It Works

Jan Mobile adapts to your situation:

-   **At Work:** Connect to your company Jan Server.
-   **On the Go:** Run Jan Nano on your phone or use a cloud model.

## Three Modes, One Experience

### Server Mode
Connect to your organization's private AI cloud for team collaboration and access to shared knowledge.

### Local Mode

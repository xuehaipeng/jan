Jan Desktop is your local AI workstation. Download it, run your own models, or connect to
cloud providers. Your computer, your choice.

## How It Works

### Default: Local Mode
Open Jan. Start chatting with Jan Nano. No internet, no account, no API keys. Your conversations
never leave your machine.

### Optional: Cloud Mode
Need more power? Connect to:
- Your own Jan Server
- jan.ai (coming soon)
- Any OpenAI-compatible API

<Aside type="caution">
**Current limitation**: You need to download a model first (2-4GB). We're embedding Jan Nano
in the app to fix this.
</Aside>

## Why Desktop First

Your desktop has the GPU, storage, and memory to run real AI models. Not toy versions. Not
demos. The same models that power ChatGPT-scale applications.

More importantly: it becomes the hub for your other devices. Your phone connects to your
desktop. Your team connects to your desktop. Everything stays in your control.

## Specifications

    Everything in `~/.local/share/jan`. Your data, your models, your configuration. Back it up, move it, delete
    it - it's just files.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Server" icon="forward-slash">
    OpenAI-compatible API at `localhost:1337`. Any tool that works with OpenAI works with Jan. No
    code changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GPU Support" icon="rocket">
    NVIDIA CUDA acceleration out of the box. Automatically detects and uses available GPUs. CPU fallback always works.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Flexibility" icon="puzzle">
    Run any GGUF model from Hugging Face. Or our models. Or your fine-tuned models. If it's GGUF, it runs.
  </Card>

## For Developers

### Use Jan as an OpenAI Drop-in

```javascript
// Your existing OpenAI code
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "not-needed",
  baseURL: "http://localhost:1337/v1"
});

// Works exactly the same
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "jan-nano",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }]
});
```

### Available Endpoints
- `/v1/chat/completions` - Chat with any loaded model
- `/v1/models` - List available models
- `/v1/embeddings` - Generate embeddings
- `/routes` - See all available routes

## The Foundation

Jan Desktop isn't just an app. It's the foundation of your personal AI infrastructure:

1. **Today**: Run models locally, connect to cloud APIs
2. **Soon**: Your phone connects to your desktop
3. **Next**: Your desktop serves your team

## Let Jan Use Your Browser

`BrowserUse` is a native tool being developed for the Jan ecosystem that will allow the AI to securely control a browser to perform tasks, automate workflows, and interact with websites just like a human would.

Think of it as an integrated, privacy-first automation layer that turns Jan from a conversational AI into a powerful agent for action.

:::note
**This tool is not yet available.** We are designing `BrowserUse` to be a core component of Jan's agentic capabilities.

### Inspired by the Best

While tools like [Browser Use](https://docs.browser-use.com/introduction) exist for developers, Jan's `BrowserUse` will be a built-in, user-friendly feature. No complex setup requiredâ€”just grant permission and let Jan handle the rest.

### Built on MCP

The tool will be implemented as a native **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server within Jan, ensuring secure and standardized communication between the AI model and the browser. This allows for powerful, auditable, and secure web interactions.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Secure Sessions**: All browsing activity happens in an isolated, sandboxed environment.
- **Natural Language Control**: Simply tell Jan what you want to do (e.g., "Book a flight," "Research this topic and summarize the top 5 findings," "Apply for this job for me").
- **Visual Understanding**: Jan will be able to see and interpret the content on pages, not just the underlying code.
- **User in the Loop**: Always ask for permission before taking critical actions like submitting forms or making purchases.

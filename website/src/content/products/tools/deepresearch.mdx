## Your Personal Research Analyst

`DeepResearch` is a planned native tool for Jan that transforms it into a powerful research agent. Give it a complex question, and it will autonomously browse, analyze, and synthesize information from numerous sources to deliver a comprehensive, structured report.

Think of it as Jan's answer to the advanced research capabilities seen in **OpenAI's ChatGPT** and **Google's Gemini**, but built in the open and with user control at its core.

### How It Will Work
Unlike a simple web search that returns a list of links, `DeepResearch` will understand your goal, create a research plan that you can edit, execute it, and deliver a final, synthesized document with citations.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Autonomous Multi-Step Research**
- **Comprehensive Source Analysis**
- **Structured Report Generation**
- **Full Transparency with Citations**
- **Local-First Privacy**

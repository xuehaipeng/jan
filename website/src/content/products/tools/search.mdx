## Answers, Not Just Links

'Search' is a planned native tool for Jan that rethinks web search. Instead of just giving you a list of links to sift through, it understands your question, scours the web, and provides a direct, synthesized answer with sources cited.

Think of it as a private, self-hosted alternative to services like **Perplexity.ai**, integrated directly into your AI assistant.

### How It's Different
- **Privacy-First:** Your search queries are processed locally and anonymized.
- **Direct Answers:** Get a concise, accurate answer compiled from the best sources.
- **Cited Sources:** Every piece of information is backed by a verifiable source.
- **Conversational Follow-up:** Ask follow-up questions in a natural way.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Real-Time Information**
- **Source Verification**
- **Customizable Focus**
- **Seamless Integration** with other tools

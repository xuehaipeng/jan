Jan Nano is a 4-billion parameter model designed for research and information retrieval. Instead of trying to know everything, it excels at finding anything through deep integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.

## Two Variants

| Model | Context Window | Size | Use Case |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Jan Nano 32k | 32,768 tokens | 4-8GB | Quick research, general queries |
| Jan Nano 128k | 131,072 tokens | 8-12GB | Deep research, document analysis |

<Aside type="note">
  Jan Nano requires MCP-enabled tools (like web search) to reach its full potential. Enable MCP in **Settings → Advanced Settings**.

## What Makes Nano Different
- **Research-First Design:** Trained to find relevant information, synthesize findings, and provide accurate citations.
- **MCP Integration:** Works seamlessly with tools like web search, document analysis, and code repositories.
- **Extended Context:** The 128k variant can process entire codebases, book-length documents, or 50+ research papers simultaneously.

## Technical Details
- **Base:** 4B parameter transformer
- **Training:** Optimized for tool use and retrieval
- **Quantization:** Q4, Q8, FP16 variants available

## Philosophy
Most models try to be encyclopedias. Jan Nano is a research assistant. It doesn't memorize the internet—it knows how to navigate it.

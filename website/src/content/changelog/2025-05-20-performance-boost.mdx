## Speed Like Never Before ‚ö°

Jan v0.6.4 delivers our biggest performance update yet. Models load faster, inference is smoother, and memory usage is dramatically reduced. This is the Jan you've been waiting for.

### üöÄ Inference Speed Improvements

Dramatic performance gains across the board:
- **3x Faster Model Loading**: Optimized model initialization reduces wait times
- **50% Faster Inference**: Improved CUDA kernels and memory management
- **Instant Model Switching**: Switch between models with near-zero delay
- **Background Preloading**: Frequently used models stay ready in memory
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent context caching reduces repeated work

### üéØ GPU Optimization Revolution

Completely rewritten GPU acceleration:
- **Auto-GPU Detection**: Automatically finds and uses your best GPU
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Distribute model layers across multiple GPUs
- **Memory Optimization**: 40% reduction in VRAM usage
- **Dynamic Offloading**: Automatically balance between GPU and CPU
- **CUDA 12 Support**: Latest NVIDIA drivers and optimizations

### üß† Smarter Memory Management

Revolutionary memory handling:
- **Adaptive Memory**: Automatically adjusts to available system memory
- **Memory Pressure Detection**: Gracefully handles low-memory situations
- **Efficient Model Unloading**: Frees memory when models aren't needed
- **Context Length Optimization**: Handle longer conversations without slowdown
- **Memory Usage Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into memory consumption

### üì± Startup Speed Breakthrough

Jan now starts in seconds, not minutes:
- **Cold Start Optimization**: 5x faster first launch
- **Background Services**: Core services start in parallel
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load components when needed
- **Configuration Caching**: Settings load instantly
- **Progressive Initialization**: UI appears immediately, features load progressively

### üîß Model Management Overhaul

Streamlined model experience:
- **One-Click Downloads**: Simplified model acquisition
- **Download Resume**: Interrupted downloads continue automatically
- **Parallel Downloads**: Download multiple models simultaneously
- **Storage Optimization**: Automatic cleanup of unused model files
- **Model Recommendations**: AI suggests optimal models for your hardware

### üíæ Storage Efficiency

Dramatic reduction in disk usage:
- **Model Compression**: 30% smaller model files without quality loss
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically removes duplicate models
- **Incremental Updates**: Only download model changes, not entire files
- **Smart Cleanup**: Removes temporary files and caches automatically
- **Storage Analytics**: See exactly what's using your disk space

### üåê Network Optimizations

Faster downloads and better connectivity:
- **CDN Integration**: Download models from the closest server
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient network resource usage
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic recovery from network interruptions
- **Bandwidth Adaptation**: Adjusts download speed to network conditions
- **Offline Mode**: Better handling when internet is unavailable

### üîç Performance Monitoring

New tools to understand performance:
- **Real-time Metrics**: See inference speed, memory usage, GPU utilization
- **Performance History**: Track performance over time
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify what's slowing down your system
- **Benchmark Tools**: Compare performance across different configurations
- **Performance Profiles**: Save optimal settings for different use cases

### üêõ Critical Fixes

Major stability improvements:
- Fixed memory leaks during long conversations
- Resolved GPU driver compatibility issues
- Eliminated random crashes during model switching
- Fixed model corruption during interrupted downloads
- Resolved race conditions in multi-threaded operations

## Technical Details

This release includes fundamental changes to our inference engine, memory management, and GPU acceleration systems. While backwards compatible, you may notice different memory usage patterns and significantly improved performance.

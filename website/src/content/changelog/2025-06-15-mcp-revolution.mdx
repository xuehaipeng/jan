## The MCP Era Begins üöÄ

Jan v0.6.5 introduces groundbreaking Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, transforming Jan from a simple chat interface into a powerful AI automation platform. Connect your AI to browsers, APIs, databases, and countless tools.

### üîó Model Context Protocol Integration

MCP opens up infinite possibilities:
- **Universal Tool Access**: Connect to any service that supports MCP
- **Real-time Data**: Access live information from APIs and databases
- **Browser Automation**: Control web browsers directly through AI commands
- **File System Access**: Read, write, and manipulate files with AI assistance
- **Custom Tools**: Build your own MCP servers for specialized workflows

### üåê Built-in MCP Servers

Launch with powerful integrations:
- **Browser Control**: Automate web tasks, scrape data, fill forms
- **File Management**: AI-powered file operations and organization
- **API Integration**: Connect to REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints
- **Database Access**: Query and update databases through natural language
- **Git Operations**: Manage repositories with AI assistance

### üéØ Smart Tool Discovery

Jan automatically discovers and configures MCP tools:
- **Auto-detection**: Finds available MCP servers on your system
- **One-click Setup**: Enable tools with simple toggle switches
- **Permission Control**: Fine-grained control over tool access
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which tools your AI uses most

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Framework

Built with security as a priority:
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Tools run in isolated environments
- **Permission System**: Explicit approval for sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete history of tool usage and permissions
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative permissions that you can expand

### üé® Redesigned Tool Interface

Beautiful new interface for tool management:
- **Visual Tool Cards**: See available tools at a glance
- **Real-time Status**: Know when tools are active or inactive
- **Interactive Setup**: Guided configuration for complex tools
- **Usage Insights**: Understand how your AI uses different tools

### üîß Developer Experience

For MCP server developers:
- **Local Development**: Test MCP servers directly in Jan
- **Debug Tools**: Built-in logging and error reporting
- **Hot Reload**: Changes to MCP servers update instantly
- **Protocol Validation**: Ensure your servers follow MCP standards

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

Under the hood optimizations:
- **Faster Tool Loading**: MCP servers start 3x faster
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory usage for tool operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of tool connections
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking tool execution

### üåü Coming Next

The MCP ecosystem is just getting started:
- More built-in integrations (Slack, Discord, GitHub)
- Visual workflow builder for complex automations
- Community marketplace for sharing MCP servers
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance features

## Breaking Changes

- Tool permissions now require explicit user approval
- Some legacy integrations have been migrated to MCP
- Configuration format updated for better security

Jan is your AI. Here's what we do with data.

<Aside type="note">
We don't collect any data without your explicit permission.
</Aside>

## 1. Data Collection and Consent

### No Data Collection Until You Allow It

Menlo Research Pte Ltd (the "Company") doesn't collect anything until you explicitly allow tracking.

### Your Choice

You'll choose tracking preferences at first launch. Change them anytime in Settings or Privacy Settings.

### Legal Basis (GDPR)

Under EU GDPR Article 6(1)(a), we process data based on your explicit consent:

- Clear consent required before any data collection
- Withdraw consent anytime through Settings
- Withdrawal doesn't affect previous lawful processing
- Processing stops immediately upon withdrawal

## 2. What We Never Collect

Jan will **never** access your chats, settings, or model choices without permission:

- **Chat History**: Your conversations stay private
- **Chat Settings**: Your personalized settings remain with you
- **Language Models**: We don't track which models you use
- **Files**: No scanning, uploading, or viewing
- **Personal Identity**: No personally identifiable information
- **Prompts**: Your prompts and templates aren't monitored
- **Conversation Metrics**: No context or conversation length tracking
- **Model Usage**: Specific models and types aren't tracked

## 3. Data We Track (With Permission)

We track basic app usage to improve Jan.

### Product Analytics

When allowed, we collect:

- **Active Users**: Daily active users to gauge engagement
- **Retention**: User retention metrics to ensure ongoing value

Everything's tied to a random ID - not your personal information. Your chats remain private.

<Aside type="note">
Your data stays private. Analytics are anonymous and aggregated.
</Aside>

## 4. Cloud Model Use

Cloud models (like GPT, Claude) need to see your messages to work. That's between you and the cloud provider - Jan facilitates the connection.

- **API Processing**: Cloud providers process your messages directly
- **Jan Access**: We don't access or store these messages
- **Local Models**: Keep everything on your device with no external access

## 5. Data Storage and Security

### Analytics Provider

[PostHog EU](https://posthog.com/eu) handles our analytics. All EU-based, GDPR-compliant data processing.

### Security Measures

- **Encryption**: All transfers use TLS encryption
- **EU Processing**: Data processed within European Union
- **Secure Storage**: PostHog manages data securely

## 6. Data Retention

- **Retention Period**: Analytics data kept for up to 12 months
- **Deletion Requests**: Request deletion by emailing hello@jan.ai
- **Legal Requirements**: May retain longer if legally required

## 7. Your Rights

- **Access and Control**: Modify tracking preferences anytime in Settings
- **Data Requests**: Contact hello@jan.ai for any data-related requests
- **Withdrawal**: Stop data collection immediately through Settings

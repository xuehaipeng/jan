## Real-World Example: Private Equity Analysis

Here's an actual deep research query demonstrating Octagon's financial analysis capabilities:

### The Prompt

```
Break apart the private equity paradox: How did an industry that promises to "unlock value" become synonymous with gutting companies, yet still attracts the world's smartest money?

Start with the mechanics—how PE firms use other people's money to buy companies with borrowed cash, then charge fees for the privilege. Trace the evolution from corporate raiders of the 1980s to today's trillion-dollar titans like Blackstone, KKR, and Apollo. Use SEC filings, M&A databases, and bankruptcy records to map their empires.

Dig into specific deals that illustrate the dual nature: companies genuinely transformed versus those stripped and flipped. Compare Toys "R" Us's death to Hilton's resurrection. Examine how PE-owned companies fare during economic downturns—do they really have "patient capital" or do they bleed portfolio companies dry through dividend recaps?

Investigate the fee structure that makes partners billionaires regardless of performance. Calculate the real returns after the 2-and-20 (or worse) fee structures. Why do pension funds and endowments keep pouring money in despite academic studies showing they'd do better in index funds?

Explore the revolving door between PE, government, and central banks. How many Fed officials and Treasury secretaries came from or went to PE? Map the political donations and lobbying expenditures that keep carried interest taxed as capital gains.

Address the human cost through labor statistics and case studies—what happens to employees when PE takes over? But also examine when PE genuinely saves failing companies and preserves jobs.

Write this as if explaining to a skeptical but curious friend over drinks—clear language, no jargon without explanation, and enough dry humor to make the absurdities apparent. Think Michael Lewis meets Matt Levine. Keep it under 3,000 words but pack it with hard data and real examples. The goal: help readers understand why PE is simultaneously capitalism's most sophisticated expression and its most primitive.

```

### Private Market Intelligence
```
Track Series B+ funding rounds in AI/ML companies in 2024. Identify valuation trends, investor concentration, and compare to public market multiples.
```

## Technical Research Capabilities

While finance-focused, Octagon also handles technical research:

### Framework Evaluation
```
Compare Kubernetes alternatives for edge computing. Consider resource usage, latency, reliability, and operational complexity with real deployment data.
```

### API Economics
```
Analyze the unit economics of major AI API providers. Include pricing history, usage patterns, and margin estimates based on reported compute costs.
```

### Open Source Sustainability
```
Research funding models for critical open source infrastructure. Which projects are at risk and what are the economic incentives misalignments?
```

Octagon's reports typically include:
- **Primary Sources**: SEC filings, earnings calls, regulatory documents
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Financial metrics, ratios, trend analysis
- **Comparative Studies**: Peer benchmarking, historical context
- **Narrative Clarity**: Complex topics explained accessibly
- **Actionable Insights**: Not just data, but implications

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication Issues:**
- Verify API key from Octagon dashboard
- Check trial status hasn't expired
- Ensure correct API key format
- Contact Octagon support if needed

**Research Failures:**
- Some queries may exceed scope (try narrowing)
- Financial data may have access restrictions
- Break complex queries into parts
- Allow time for comprehensive research

**Tool Calling Problems:**
- Not all models handle multiple tools well
- Kimi-k2 via OpenRouter works reliably
- Claude 3.5+ Sonnet also recommended
- Enable tool calling in model settings

**Performance Considerations:**
- Deep research takes time (be patient)
- Complex financial analysis may take minutes
- Monitor API usage in dashboard
- Consider query complexity vs urgency

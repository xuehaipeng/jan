## Integrate OpenRouter with Jan

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a tool that gathers AI model APIs and provides access to all
via a unified API. Developers can use the API to interact with LLMs, generative image models, and
even models that generate 3D objects, all with a competitive pricing.

Jan supports the OpenRouter API, allowing you to use models from various providers (Anthropic, Google,
Meta and more) and helping you avoid having to get an API from all of your favorite ones.

OpenRouter even offers a few free models! ðŸ™Œ

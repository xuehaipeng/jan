2. Select an Gemini model from **model selector**

## Available Google Models

Jan automatically includes Google's available models like Gemini series. In case you want to use a specific
Gemini model that you cannot find in **Jan**, follow instructions in [Add Cloud Models](/docs/manage-models#add-models-1):
- See list of available models in [Google Models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list. For example, `gemini-1.5-pro` or `gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview`.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your Google account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify [Gemini's system status](https://www.google.com/appsstatus/dashboard/)
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your Google account has the necessary permissions

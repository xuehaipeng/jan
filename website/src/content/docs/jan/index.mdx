## Jan's Goal

> Jan's goal is to build superintelligence that you can self-host and use locally.

## What is Jan?

Jan is an open-source AI ecosystem that runs on your hardware.

- **Available Today**: Jan Desktop - run AI models on your computer with zero setup
- **Coming Soon**: Complete ecosystem with specialized models, tools, and cross-device sync

### The Stack

**Models**: Specialized AI models trained for real tasks (search, analysis, writing)
**Tools**: Browser automation, web search, memory systems via MCP
**Applications**: Desktop (now), Web/Mobile/Server (coming 2025)

Everything works together. Everything runs where you want it.

<Aside type="tip">
No API keys required. No account needed. Just download and use.
</Aside>

## Core Features

### Run Models Locally
- Download any GGUF model from Hugging Face
- Use our Jan models optimized for specific tasks
- Automatic GPU acceleration (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel)
- OpenAI-compatible API at `localhost:1337`

### Connect to Cloud (Optional)
- Your API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- Jan.ai cloud models (coming soon)
- Self-hosted Jan Server

### Extend with Tools
- Web search via MCP
- Browser automation
- File parsing and analysis
- Custom tool development

## Architecture

Jan is built on:
- [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for inference
- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for tools
- Local-first data storage in `~/jan`

## Why Jan?

| Feature | Other AI Platforms | Jan |
|:--------|:-------------------|:----|
| **Deployment** | Their servers only | Your device, your servers, or our cloud |
| **Models** | One-size-fits-all | Specialized models for specific tasks |
| **Data** | Stored on their servers | Stays on your hardware |
| **Cost** | Monthly subscription | Free locally, pay for cloud |
| **Extensibility** | Limited APIs | Full ecosystem with MCP tools |

## Development Philosophy

1. **Local First**: Everything works offline. Cloud is optional.
2. **User Owned**: Your data, your models, your compute.
3. **Built in Public**: Watch our models train. See our code. Track our progress.

<Aside>
We're building AI that respects your choices. Not another wrapper around someone else's API.
</Aside>

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: 8GB RAM, 10GB storage
**Recommended**: 16GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU, 50GB storage
**Supported**: Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

- [Model Testing](https://eval.jan.ai) - Help evaluate models
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this just another ChatGPT wrapper?</strong></summary>

No. We're building:
- Our own models trained for specific tasks
- Complete local AI infrastructure
- Tools that extend model capabilities
- An ecosystem that works offline

ChatGPT is one model behind an API. Jan is a complete AI platform you own.

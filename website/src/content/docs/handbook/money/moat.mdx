title: "What is our moat?"
description: "Building defensibility through community, trust, and aligned incentives"

Traditional moats rely on keeping secrets, locking in users, or maintaining
technical advantages. Jan's moat is different—it's built on openness, community,
and aligned values that are impossible to replicate with a closed approach.

## Community as Competitive Advantage

Our strongest moat is our community. While others guard their code, we share everything:

### Network Effects at Scale
- Every user improves Jan for everyone else
- Bug reports, feature requests, and contributions compound
- Community support scales infinitely
- Local communities solve local problems

### Trust Through Transparency
- Open source code earns trust closed systems can't buy
- Users verify our privacy claims themselves
- No hidden agendas or dark patterns
- Mistakes are public, fixes are collaborative

### Innovation Velocity
- Thousands of contributors vs hundreds of employees
- Global perspectives vs Silicon Valley groupthink
- 24/7 development across time zones
- Passionate users become passionate builders

## Technical Moats

### Local-First Architecture
While others race to build bigger data centers, we're optimizing for edge computing:
- Years of optimization for consumer hardware
- Deep integration with local systems
- Efficient model quantization expertise
- Cross-platform compatibility knowledge

### Privacy-Preserving Design
Privacy isn't a feature we added—it's our foundation:
- Architecture that makes surveillance impossible
- No user data to monetize or leak
- Local-first eliminates attack surfaces
- Trust that compounds over time

### Model Agnostic Platform
We're not tied to any single model:
- Support for all open models
- Jan Exam ensures quality across providers
- Users aren't locked to our models
- Best-in-class always available

## Business Model Alignment

Our moat strengthens because our business model reinforces our values:

### No Conflict of Interest
- We don't profit from user data
- No ads means no perverse incentives
- Success comes from user success
- Premium features enhance, not gatekeep

### Sustainable Growth
- Open source distribution = zero CAC
- Community support = reduced support costs
- User contributions = free R&D
- Word of mouth = organic growth

## Cultural Moats

### Values Alignment
Users choose Jan because they share our values:
- Privacy is non-negotiable
- Ownership matters
- Local-first is the future
- Community over corporation

### Mission-Driven Team
- We attract talent that believes in the mission
- Lower salaries offset by meaningful work
- Equity alignment with long-term vision
- Cultural fit over pure technical skills

## The Anti-Moat Strategy

Paradoxically, our moat comes from not trying to build traditional moats:

### No Lock-In Creates Loyalty
- Easy to leave = users choose to stay
- Export everything = trust in the platform
- No switching costs = genuine preference
- Freedom of choice = actual choice

### Open Source as Defense
- Can't be acquired and shut down
- Can't be feature-frozen by new management
- Community can fork if we lose our way
- Immortal through decentralization

## Compounding Advantages

Our moats compound over time:

```
Year 1: Build trust through transparency
Year 2: Community starts contributing significantly
Year 3: Network effects accelerate development
Year 4: Ecosystem becomes self-sustaining
Year 5: Platform effect makes leaving costly (by choice)
```

## What Can't Be Copied

Competitors can't replicate:

### Time and Trust
- Years of consistent privacy-first decisions
- Track record of putting users first
- Community relationships built over time
- Reputation for reliability and openness

### Community Culture
- Shared values and mission
- Collaborative problem-solving approach
- Global perspective on AI needs
- Bottom-up innovation mindset

### Architectural Decisions
- Local-first can't be bolted onto cloud-first
- Privacy can't be added to surveillance systems
- Community-driven can't be faked by corporations
- Open source commitment can't be half-hearted

## The Ultimate Moat

Our ultimate moat is simple: **we're building what we'd want to use**.

- We're users of our own platform
- We feel the pain points personally
- We can't betray users without betraying ourselves
- Our incentives perfectly align with our community

## Sustainable Defensibility

Traditional moats erode:
- Patents expire
- Technical advantages get copied
- Network effects can shift platforms
- Regulations can break monopolies

Jan's moats strengthen:
- Trust compounds daily
- Community grows stronger
- Values attract like-minded people
- Open source ensures immortality

## Conclusion

Our moat isn't about keeping others out—it's about bringing everyone in. By building in the open, aligning our incentives with users, and creating genuine value, we're building defensibility that transcends traditional business strategy.

The question isn't "How do we prevent competition?" but rather "How do we make competition irrelevant by building something that can't exist any other way?"

That's our moat: being the platform that puts users first, not because it's good business, but because it's the only way to build the AI future we want to live in.

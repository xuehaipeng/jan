Jan is building a sustainable business that aligns our incentives with our users'
success. We believe the best way to build beneficial AI is to ensure our business
model reinforces our values: privacy, ownership, and universal access.

## Our Business Model

### 1. Open Core Foundation

**Jan Desktop is free forever**
- Download and run AI models locally

## Revenue Philosophy

### What We'll Never Do

- **Sell your data**: Your conversations remain private

- **Paywall core features**: Local AI remains free
- **Compromise on privacy**: No ads, no tracking, no surveillance

### What We Always Do

- **Align incentives**: We succeed when you succeed with AI
- **Transparent pricing**: Clear, predictable costs
- **Community first**: Free tier remains fully functional
- **Open standards**: No proprietary lock-in

## Unit Economics

Our approach creates sustainable unit economics:

1. **Zero marginal cost** for open-source users
2. **High-margin** cloud and enterprise services
3. **Network effects** as community grows
4. **Reduced CAC** through open-source distribution

## The Flywheel

```
Open Source Adoption â†’ Community Growth â†’ Better Models â†’
More Users â†’ Enterprise Adoption â†’ Revenue â†’ Investment in Open Source
```

Each turn of the wheel strengthens the next:
- More users improve models through feedback
- Better models attract enterprise customers
- Enterprise revenue funds open development
- Open development attracts more users

## Long-term Vision

We're building for a future where:

- Every organization runs their own AI
- Privacy is the default, not premium
- Open models outperform closed ones
- AI infrastructure is as common as web servers

Our business model ensures we'll be here to see it through.

We encourage team members to represent Jan at conferences and travel for in-person alignment

For all work travel, we ask that you get approval from HR before confirming your trip & booking flights/hotels.

### Bookings

We prefer to directly book flights & hotels on your behalf, through our travel portals.

If you need to arrange travel by yourself, please obtain a travel budget first. Save all receipts for reimbursement.

### Per Diem

Depending on the location, we provide a $20 USD per diem for meals and incidentals. This amount is adjustable based on the location.

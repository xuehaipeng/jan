We are incredibly frugal and intend to be around in 50 years. However, we avoid being "penny-wise & pound-foolish" and spend when it matters.

### Expenses

#### Software

For software subscriptions and other expenses incurred as a part of [benefits](compensation#benefits), please save receipts and submit it as a reimbursement [request](#reimbursements).

#### Large Purchases

For larger purchases like equipment, please first submit a purchase request through `#admin-requests` in Discord.

We can directly order for you or reimburse you for the purchase.

#### Incidentals

We don't have a policy for incidentals. We trust you to make the right decisions, while keeping in mind that we are a startup and every dollar counts.

### Reimbursements

Reimbursements are processed at the end of every month with payroll.

Email all receipts (required) & the following form to `finance@menlo.ai`:

| Date       | Description | Amount | Currency | Exchange Rate | Total (USD) |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|

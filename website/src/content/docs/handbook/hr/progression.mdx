### Promotions

We don't believe in titles. We believe in fair compensation and fast progression.

> Previously, we have been known to organically promote team members 2x within 6 months of joining.

### Perks

- Your contributions are Open Source and public
- Speaking opportunities at conferences (we get invited often)
- Direct access to a large network of advisors
- No shortage of hard problems (you don't need to "prove" yourself before working on something interesting)
- Visibility across our hardware, software, and research projects
- Real, blunt feedback, at scale (our users are not shy!)
- Hard, tough, evergreen problems

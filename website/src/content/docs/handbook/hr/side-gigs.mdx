title: "Side Gigs"
description: "Best practices around external engagements."

We have a permissive policy regarding side gigs, similar to [Posthog's](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/side-gigs).

However, our main ask is for Jan to be your "main gig", as you will be taking a crucial role in success/failure of Jan. Manage your time in a way that is fair to the company and your colleagues.

At the end of the day, you all own (or will own) shares of the company. Handle company IP as you would your own property.

### Declaration

**For work in related industries, we do ask for an upfront declaration**, so that we can clear potential conflicts of interest.

Please fill out the following form and submit it to: `hr@menlo.ai`

| Dates       | Organization | Nature of Work | Hours/week |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
|             |              |                |            |
|             |              |                |            |
|             |              |                |            |

### A Note on IP

Startups & careers die because of IP disputes from moonlighting employees. Please respect all party's IP - never intermingle assets (like laptops and logins) between engagements.

We don't schedule recurring 1-on-1s, because in our experience, engineers and researchers [hate it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14rkbwv/does_anybody_else_hate_their_11_meetings/). We believe it's better to address issues and provide feedback as they arise.

If you need to discuss something with us, simply book a time on the founder or team lead's calendar. **We're always available to chat.**

✅ Do:
- Schedule check-ins as soon as you need them
- Provide honest feedback and criticism (we appreciate it!)

❌ Don't:
- Wait for a scheduled one-on-one to raise issues
- Ask for confirmation before scheduling a check-in

### Exceptions

If you'd like to establish regular check-ins, please let us know and we're very happy to set one up.

description: "Building superintelligence that you can own and run anywhere"
---

Current AI platforms force unnecessary trade-offs:

- **All or Nothing**: Either use their cloud or build everything yourself from scratch
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Your prompts, workflows, and knowledge trapped in one platform
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Same solution whether you're a student or an enterprise
- **Rent Forever**: Monthly subscriptions for software that should be yours
- **Limited Deployment**: Can't run where you need it - offline, on-premises, or at the edge

## Mission

Jan is building a complete AI ecosystem that adapts to how you want to work. We believe AI should be:

- **Truly Owned**: Like any software, download it and it's yours forever
- **Infinitely Flexible**: Run locally, self-host, or use our cloud - same experience
- **Professionally Complete**: Not just models, but the full stack of tools and applications
- **Universally Deployable**: From your laptop to your data center to the edge

## The Full Stack Approach

We're not building another chatbot. We're building superintelligence you can own:

### Models That Specialize
- **Jan Models**: Purpose-built for specific tasks (search, analysis, writing)
- **Community Models**: Any GGUF model from Hugging Face
- **Cloud Models**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or others when needed
- **Your Models**: Fine-tune and deploy your own

### Tools That Extend
- **Search**: Get answers, not just links
- **DeepResearch**: Multi-step autonomous research
- **BrowserUse**: Let AI interact with the web for you
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to any data source or service

### Applications That Scale
- **Jan Desktop**: Your local AI workstation
- **Jan.ai**: Web access with no setup
- **Jan Mobile**: AI that follows you (coming soon)
- **Jan Server**: Your own private AI cloud (coming soon)

## Why This Matters

In 5 years, AI will be embedded in everything you do. The question isn't whether you'll use AI, but how:

**Option A**: Rent access from tech giants, accept their limitations, lose your data when you stop paying

**Option B**: Own your AI infrastructure, deploy it anywhere, keep everything you build

We're making Option B not just possible, but better than Option A.

## The Problem With Status Quo

### Cloud-Only Platforms
- Can't work offline
- Can't handle sensitive data
- Can't customize deeply
- Can't control costs

### DIY Open Source
- Requires deep technical knowledge
- Fragmented tools and models
- No unified experience
- Massive integration overhead

### Jan's Solution
- Download and run in minutes
- Complete ecosystem out of the box
- Scale from laptop to cluster
- Switch between local and cloud seamlessly

## Real Problems We Solve Today

### For Developers
"I want to use AI in my app but don't want vendor lock-in"
→ OpenAI-compatible API that runs anywhere

### For Teams
"We need AI but can't send data to the cloud"
→ Self-host Jan Server on your infrastructure

### For Individuals
"I want ChatGPT capabilities without the subscription"
→ Download Jan Desktop and own your AI

### For Enterprises
"We need to scale AI across different deployment scenarios"
→ One platform that works from edge to cloud

## Vision

We envision a future where:

- AI runs wherever you have compute - laptop, phone, server, edge device
- You own your AI infrastructure like you own your other software
- Models, tools, and applications work together seamlessly
- The best AI isn't gated behind corporate APIs

Jan is the platform that makes this future real, today.

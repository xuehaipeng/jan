Engineers and creators who need:
- The freedom to run models locally or in the cloud
- Complete control over their AI stack
- The ability to switch providers without losing their work
- Integration options that fit their existing workflows

### Individuals Who Value Ownership
People who understand that AI should be like any other software:
- Download it once, use it forever
- Your conversations and data belong to you
- No vendor lock-in or subscription traps

title: "Our Vision for Open Superintelligence"
description: "Building superintelligence that you can own, modify, and deploy however you want"
---

Jan believes the path to superintelligence isn't through one massive model controlled by a few companies. It's through an ecosystem of specialized models, tools, and applications that anyone can own and deploy.

## What is Open Superintelligence?

Open superintelligence is AI that:

- **Works Everywhere**: From your laptop to your data center to the edge
- **Belongs to You**: Download it, modify it, deploy it - it's yours
- **Scales Infinitely**: Same AI whether you're one person or ten thousand
- **Evolves with Community**: Thousands of contributors, not hundreds of employees

## The Ecosystem Approach

Superintelligence isn't one thing - it's many things working together:

### Specialized Models
Instead of one model trying to do everything:
- **Jan-Search** excels at finding and synthesizing information
- **Jan-Write** understands creativity and structure
- **Jan-Analyze** specializes in reasoning and data
- **Jan-Code** focuses on programming tasks

Each model does one thing brilliantly, and they hand off tasks to each other.

### Extensible Tools
Models alone aren't enough. Our tools make them useful:
- Search the web and get answers, not links
- Automate browser tasks naturally
- Parse documents and understand context
- Connect to your data sources via MCP

### Flexible Deployment
One codebase, infinite configurations:
- **Local Mode**: Everything on your hardware
- **Server Mode**: Self-host for your team
- **Cloud Mode**: We host it for you
- **Hybrid Mode**: Mix and match as needed

## Why Ownership Matters

When you own your AI infrastructure:

### You Control the Experience
- Customize models for your specific needs
- Build workflows that match how you work
- Integrate with your existing tools
- Scale based on your requirements

### You Keep What You Build
- Your prompts and conversations
- Your fine-tuned models
- Your custom workflows
- Your accumulated knowledge

### You Choose How to Run
- Offline when you need privacy
- Cloud when you need power
- Local when you need speed
- Distributed when you need scale

## Building in Public

We're not building this in secret. Everything is open:

### Watch Us Train
See our models being trained in real-time at [train.jan.ai](https://train.jan.ai):
- Live loss curves
- Training datasets
- Failed experiments
- Actual progress

### Test With Us
Help evaluate models at [eval.jan.ai](https://eval.jan.ai):
- Compare outputs side-by-side
- Vote on what actually works
- Suggest improvements
- See all the data

### Build With Us
Everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/janhq):
- Contribute code
- Report issues
- Suggest features
- Fork and modify

## The Path to Superintelligence

### Today: Foundation (âœ…)
- Jan Desktop works with local and cloud models
- Basic tools via MCP
- Community growing rapidly

### Next 12 Months: Ecosystem
- Jan v1 models optimized for specific tasks
- Jan Server for self-hosted deployments
- Advanced tools (browser automation, deep research)
- Cross-device synchronization

### Future: True Superintelligence
- Models that understand your context
- Tools that act on your behalf
- Applications that work everywhere
- An ecosystem that belongs to everyone

## Our Commitment

We commit to building superintelligence that:

### Stays Open
- Core will always be open source
- Models will always be downloadable
- Standards will always be public
- Development will always be transparent

### Stays Flexible
- Run it anywhere you have compute
- Mix local and cloud as needed
- Scale up or down instantly
- Switch providers without friction

### Stays Yours
- No vendor lock-in
- No forced updates
- No subscription traps
- No data exploitation

## Why This Approach Wins

### Network Effects
Every user makes Jan better:
- Bug reports improve stability
- Feature requests guide development
- Model feedback enhances quality
- Community support helps everyone

### Compound Innovation
Open development accelerates progress:
- Best ideas come from anywhere
- Solutions shared instantly
- Problems solved collectively
- Innovation happens 24/7

### Aligned Incentives
We succeed when you succeed:
- Your productivity is our metric
- Your ownership is our philosophy
- Your freedom is our product
- Your success is our business model

## Join the Movement

This isn't just about building better AI. It's about ensuring the most powerful technology in human history belongs to humanity, not corporations.

Whether you:
- Use Jan for daily work
- Contribute code or ideas
- Share it with others
- Build on top of it
- Deploy it in your organization

You're part of building superintelligence that everyone can own.

## The Choice is Yours

In five years, AI will be everywhere. The question is:

**Will you rent intelligence from a monopoly, or will you own your own superintelligence?**

With Jan, you don't have to choose between powerful and private, between cloud and local, between easy and extensible.

You get it all. And it's yours.

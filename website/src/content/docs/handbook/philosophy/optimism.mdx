> "Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." — Winston Churchill

In 1903, [we barely left the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer). By 1969, [we stood on the moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11). What once seemed impossible became reality through persistence and optimism.

## Augmenting Humanity

- We reject AI doomerism. Focus on possibilities, not fear
- Children represent our hope. We build for their future
- Humanity progresses faster than it feels
- AI is a tool—like electricity or the telephone. It's not the first revolution, nor the last
- History shows resilience. We adapt, mitigate risks, and move forward
- Airplanes once terrified—yet they helped humanity reach the moon and connect the world

## AI Safety

- Safety is non-negotiable. Protecting people is the baseline
  - AI safety == human safety. If we haven’t solved human safety, we haven’t solved AI safety.
  - AI alignment == human alignment. Misaligned societies can’t build aligned systems.
- AI safety requires human alignment first
- Fear and progress must be balanced—panic stalls; awareness guides
- Building for our kids ensures safety is built-in, purpose drives caution
- Airplanes once terrified—yet they helped humanity reach the moon and connect the world

## Why we believe in optimism

- Optimism drives solutions; fear paralyzes
- Hope fuels persistence. Failures aren't endpoints
- Every breakthrough began as a dream. We build toward better because we believe in it
- Perpetual optimism multiplies effort and impact

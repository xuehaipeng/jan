## Our Approach

At Jan, we don't chase the bleeding edge for its own sake. We take proven, battle-tested technologies and combine them in innovative ways to solve real problems. This philosophy shapes everything we build.

## Why Proven Technology Wins

### Stability Over Novelty
- **GGUF Format**: We didn't invent a new model format. We adopted the community standard that already works across platforms
- **llama.cpp**: Years of optimization by brilliant minds—why reinvent when we can build upon?
- **Tauri + Web Tech**: Proven UI stack that works everywhere, letting us focus on AI innovation
- **SQLite**: The world's most deployed database for local data—perfect for privacy-first architecture

### Accessibility Through Maturity
When we use proven technology:
- Hardware requirements are well understood
- Optimization paths are clear
- Community knowledge exists
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Edge cases are known

This means Jan works on more devices, for more people, with fewer surprises.

## Lateral Innovation Examples

### Local AI That Actually Works
**Traditional approach**: Build massive cloud infrastructure, require constant internet
**Our approach**: Use proven quantization techniques to run powerful models on consumer hardware

### Privacy Without Compromise
**Traditional approach**: Complex encryption and privacy theater
**Our approach**: Simply don't collect data. Use local SQLite. Problem solved.

### Universal Model Support
**Traditional approach**: Proprietary model formats and exclusive partnerships
**Our approach**: Support the open GGUF standard that the community already uses

### Cross-Platform Without Complexity
**Traditional approach**: Native apps for each platform, massive development overhead
**Our approach**: One codebase using Electron, works everywhere, ships faster

## The Power of Constraints

Working with proven technology creates healthy constraints:

### Resource Efficiency
- Can't throw infinite compute at problems
- Must optimize for consumer hardware
- Forces elegant solutions over brute force
- Makes us accessible globally, not just in rich markets

### Clear Boundaries
- Known limitations guide design decisions
- Realistic about what's possible today
- Focus on solving real problems now
- Build stepping stones to the future

### Community Alignment
- Use formats the community knows
- Build on protocols people trust
- Contribute improvements back upstream
- Stand on the shoulders of giants

## Innovation Through Integration

Our innovation comes from how we combine proven pieces:

```
llama.cpp (proven inference)
    + GGUF (standard format)
    + Electron (cross-platform UI)
    + SQLite (local data)
    + MCP (extensibility)
    = Jan (accessible AI for everyone)
```

Each component is battle-tested. The magic is in the combination.

## Real Problems, Real Solutions

This philosophy keeps us grounded:

### What We Build
- AI that runs on the laptop you already own
- Privacy that doesn't require a PhD to understand
- Tools that work offline in rural areas
- Features users actually need today

### What We Don't Build
- Exotic architectures that need exotic hardware
- Complex systems that break in simple ways
- Features that demo well but fail in practice
- Solutions looking for problems

## The Compound Effect

Using proven technology creates compounding benefits:

1. **Faster Development**: Less time debugging novel approaches
2. **Better Reliability**: Years of battle-testing by others
3. **Easier Adoption**: Users already understand the patterns
4. **Stronger Ecosystem**: Can leverage existing tools and knowledge
5. **Lower Costs**: Commodity hardware and proven optimizations

## Learning from History

Great innovations often use "old" technology in new ways:
- The iPhone used existing touchscreen tech
- Tesla started with laptop batteries
- SpaceX used proven rocket designs more efficiently
- The web succeeded using simple protocols

Jan follows this tradition: proven AI inference, standard formats, and simple principles—combined in a way that makes AI accessible to everyone.

## Building for the Long Term

Proven technology has staying power:
- Standards that last decades
- Protocols that survive company failures
- Formats that outlive their creators
- Communities that maintain forever

By building on these foundations, Jan can focus on what matters: making AI useful, private, and accessible to everyone.

## Our Commitment

We commit to:
- **Practical over Perfect**: Ship what works today
- **Simple over Sophisticated**: Elegant solutions to real problems
- **Proven over Promising**: Build on solid foundations
- **Accessible over Advanced**: Reach everyone, not just enthusiasts

## The Future is Already Here

The technologies needed for private, local AI already exist. They're proven, optimized, and ready. Our job isn't to invent new technology—it's to combine what exists in ways that serve humanity.

That's lateral thinking. That's how we build the future: not by reaching for tomorrow's technology, but by using today's technology in tomorrow's ways.

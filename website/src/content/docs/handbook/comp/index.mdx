### Pay

Everyone at Jan is on the same payscale, with cost of living adjustments based on [location](#location).

Your base cash pay is determined based on realized impact, not titles. Workstream owners, responsible for the success/failure of a project & team, are compensated more than individual contributors. Folks at the same contribution levels receive equitable base pay.

Based on your [progression](progression) speed, we have been known to adjust pay frequently and aggressively.

### Location

We provide a location adjustment for folks living in a high cost of living area. We use the [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) index to arrive at a fair & equitable total.

### Bonus

Depending on location, we pay a discretionary cash bonus twice per year. The bonus typically ranges from 5-17% of your base pay, and is based on the company's performance and your individual contribution.

### ESOP

We offer an employee stock ownership plan to all full-time employees. The ESOP is a key part of our compensation package and is designed to align everyone's incentives with the long-term success of the company. Read our [ESOP policy](esop).

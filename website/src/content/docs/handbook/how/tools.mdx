We like to make AI do the boring stuff. We also automate and dogfood our own tools as much as possible.

### Tools

- **Github**: For engineering specs, sprint planning, and documentation.
- **Discord**: For chat, voice, and video calls.
- **Google Hangouts**: For a short, daily standup.
- **Gmail**: For external communication.
- **HackMD/Obsidian**: For ad hoc ideas and meeting notes.
- **Excalidraw**: For whiteboarding.
- **Password Manager**: You will be invited.
- **Jan/Cortex**: A personal, private copilot.

### Infrastructure

We use a mix of cloud providers and build our on-premises hardware to cut costs and optimize performance.

- Singapore Cluster: For training and inference.
- Hanoi Cluster: For CI/CD and data pipelines.
- Burst Compute: We like Runpod for larger training runs.

See [Infra](/handbook/infra/infra) for more details.

### CI/CD

We have a dedicated devops/mlops team. Ping in the `infra-internal` channel for any requests.

### Automations

We have a dedicated automations engineer. Her goal is to automate yesterday's tasks today, so that you are doing something different tomorrow.

Ping in the `#automations` channel for any requests.

We don't hire for skills alone. We hire for obsession.

## Find the obsessed

- Breakthroughs require long-term focus, not fleeting interest
- Failure isn't the end—just another step in relentless experimentation
- People who obsess push beyond limits others accept

## We seek those already consumed

- You're already working on the problem—because you can't not
- We don't assign you a job; we support your life's work
- Obsession isn't just personal—it becomes more powerful in a team
- Together, a group of obsessives becomes greater than the sum of its parts

## The best hires share common traits

- Desperation: Solving the problem feels like a need, not a choice
- Relentlessness: You try, fail, adapt—again and again
- Defiance: Others call it crazy; we call it genius

## We're looking for the dreamers

- That deep, persistent song you've been trying to sing? We hear it
- Maybe you've been mocked, dismissed, or misunderstood
- We seek those lonely, weird dreamers who refuse to give up

Wherever you are in the world, if this feels like you—apply here

Jan is a sports team, not unlike a NBA team or a NFL team. We focus on putting the best players on the court, focusing on their 1% strengths, and building a team that can win together.

## Team vs. Family

We learn the best principles from [Netflix Culture Deck](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/culture-1798664/1798664):

- We operate like a pro sports team
- There are limited spots on every team — every roster spot counts
- We hire, develop and cut smartly

## Continuity

However, we balance this with our belief in Continuity and Stability:

- Teams with psychological safety take better, long-term risks
- Teams need 2–3 years to truly gel
- Continuity matters; balance change carefully
- Cohesive teams outperform constant reshuffles
- Time builds trust, speed, and better decisions

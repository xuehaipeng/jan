We hire from unconventional backgrounds.

## Opportunity isn't equal

- Where you're born shapes your chances—but it shouldn't define them
- Talent is everywhere. Opportunity isn't
- We believe the internet has changed how we work and live together. Our team—spread across 10 cities worldwide—couldn't have existed just five years ago
- Fast connections (5G and beyond) mean geography no longer decides your future. We'll find you—wherever you are

## We seek the overlooked

- Lonely geniuses, relentless tinkerers, people with potential others missed
- We don't care where you went to school—or if you went at all
- We bet on people like startups: high risk, high potential
- Skills can be taught; drive cannot. We'll teach you to communicate and collaborate
- We trust you'll prove yourself through your work and integrity

## Meaningful work, close to home

- We create jobs that matter, in the places people call home
- If Jan's greatest achievement is enabling people to build meaningful careers in their hometowns—that would be success worth celebrating

## This is your shot

- Underdogs, dreamers, the overlooked—this place is for you
- We don't just welcome you. We're looking for you
- Wherever you are in the world—apply here

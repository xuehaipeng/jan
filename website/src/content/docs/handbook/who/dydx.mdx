The rate of a function is more important than its starting point. We value growth
rate over initial advantage.

## Why slope matters

- Knowledge fades, but the ability to learn compounds
- A fast learner will outpace someone with more initial experience over time
- Slow, steady improvement outperforms quick starts with no growth

## What it means day-to-day

- Don't hesitate to try something new—even if you start clueless. Learning speed matters
- Mistakes are expected. Learning from them is required
- We'll invest in helping you grow, but the drive has to come from you
- Your trajectory is more important than where you begin

## Why we believe in this

- Building something lasting requires patience and commitment to improvement
- We're not interested in shortcuts. We value the work that compounds quietly until it becomes obvious
- If Jan's greatest impact is helping people and ideas grow steadily over time—that's the kind of success we stand for

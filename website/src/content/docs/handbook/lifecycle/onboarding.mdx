Welcome to Jan! We are excited to have you join our team. This guide walks you through the onboarding process.

> You will receive an onboarding invitation morning of your first day. Prior to the scheduled onboarding call, please send your Github & Discord handles to `hr@menlo.ai`.

### Expectations

| Expectation | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Take Initiative** | Take ownership of an area. If you see a problem, take it and own it to completion. Your work will often not be defined. Take the initiative to figure out what needs to be done, seek clarification, and then communicate what your plan to the team. |
| **Bias to Action** | There are many problems to solve. Don't ask for permission or try to build consensus - just take action. After 2-3 months, you should be able to show clear results having turned around a problem-filled area. |
| **Communication** | Clear and timely communication is key. If unsure, ask questions. We are a global team and respect is paramount. Disrespectful behavior is not tolerated. Focus on problem-solving, not personal attacks. Assume Hanlon’s Razor: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by lack of ~~stupidity~~ communication or ambiguity.” |
| **Mastery** | In this frontier industry, expertise comes from doing. Own your area and build mastery. |

For more details, see our guides on [remote work](/handbook/how/remote).

### Code of Conduct

- **Availability and Communication**: Ensure you are available and engaged during designated work hours and scheduled meetings.
- **Work Environment**: Strive to create a quiet and distraction-free workspace whenever possible, especially on video calls.
- **Video Participation**: Video participation is expected unless there are exceptional circumstances.
- **Dress Code**: Casual attire is perfectly acceptable for meetings, but please exercise good judgment (e.g. no pajamas).
- **Vacations:** Communicate leave at least 2 weeks (1 sprint) in advance via Bamboo.
- **Emergency Leave:** Please inform Daniel, Nicole and HR in your #hr-channel if you require emergency leave.
- **Side Gigs Policy**: See [side-gigs](side-gigs). Please consult with HR on engagements with potential legal & IP implications.
- **Sexual harassment:** We have a zero tolerance policy against behavior of a sexual nature that could reasonably be expected to cause offense or humiliation, e.g. verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct, via written and electronic communications.

## Your Private AI Cloud

Jan Server allows you to deploy a powerful, multi-user AI environment on your
own infrastructure. It's designed for teams and enterprises that require full
data control, privacy, and predictable costs without sacrificing performance.

<Aside type="note">
**Jan Server is not yet available.** We are building a robust, scalable solution for self-hosting.
</Aside>

By self-hosting, you ensure that your sensitive data and intellectual property never leave your network.

### Core Features Planned:
- **Multi-User Management**: Control access with individual accounts and API keys.
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Integrate with your existing SSO, LDAP, or AD.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Deploy easily via Docker, Kubernetes, or on bare metal.
- **Centralized Admin Dashboard**: Monitor usage, manage models, and oversee system health.

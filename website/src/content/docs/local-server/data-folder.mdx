## Monitoring Server Logs

When Jan's local server is running, you can monitor real-time activity in the logs folder:

![API Server Logs](../../../assets/api-server-logs.png)

### Live Log Monitoring

**Real-time logs show:**
- API requests and responses
- Model loading and inference activity
- Error messages and warnings
- Performance metrics
- Connection attempts from external applications

**Accessing logs:**
- **In Jan**: System Monitor (footer) > App Log
- **File location**: `/logs/app.log`

### Log Categories

| Log Type | What It Shows | When It's Useful |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **[APP]** | Core application events | Startup issues, crashes, general errors |
| **[SERVER]** | API server activity | Connection problems, request failures |
| **[SPECS]** | Hardware information | Performance issues, compatibility problems |
| **[MODEL]** | Model operations | Loading failures, inference errors |

## Key Folders Explained

### `/logs/` - Server Activity Hub
Contains all application and server logs. Essential for troubleshooting and monitoring API activity.

**What you'll find:**
- Real-time server requests
- Model loading status
- Error diagnostics
- Performance data

### `/models/` - AI Model Storage
Where your downloaded models live. Each model includes:
- `model.gguf` - The actual AI model file
- `model.json` - Configuration and metadata

### `/threads/` - Chat History
Every conversation gets its own folder with:
- `messages.jsonl` - Complete chat history
- `thread.json` - Thread metadata and settings

### `/assistants/` - AI Personalities
Configuration files that define how your AI assistants behave, including their instructions and available tools.

## Privacy & Security

**Your data stays local:**
- No cloud backups or syncing
- Files stored in standard JSON/JSONL formats
- Complete control over your data
- Easy to backup or migrate

**File permissions:**
- Only you and Jan can access these files
- Standard user-level permissions
- No elevated access required

<Aside type="note">
When using cloud AI services through Jan, those conversations follow the cloud provider's data policies. Local model conversations never leave your computer.
</Aside>

## Common Tasks

### Backup Your Data
Copy the entire Jan data folder to backup:
- All chat history
- Model configurations
- Assistant settings
- Extension data

### Clear Chat History
Delete individual thread folders in `/threads/` or use Jan's interface to delete conversations.

### Export Conversations
Thread files are in standard JSON format - readable by any text editor or compatible with other applications.

### Troubleshooting Data Issues
1. Check `/logs/app.log` for error messages
2. Verify folder permissions
3. Ensure sufficient disk space
4. Restart Jan if files appear corrupted

## Uninstalling Jan

If you need to completely remove Jan and all data:

**Keep data (reinstall later):** Just uninstall the application
**Remove everything:** Delete the Jan data folder after uninstalling

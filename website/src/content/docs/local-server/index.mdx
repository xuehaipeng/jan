Jan Local Server provides an OpenAI-compatible API that runs entirely on your computer. Build AI applications using familiar API patterns while keeping complete control over your data and models.

## How It Works

Jan runs a local server powered by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) that provides an OpenAI-compatible API. By default, it runs at `https://localhost:1337` and works completely offline.

**What this enables:**
- Connect development tools like [Continue](./continue-dev) and [Cline](https://cline.bot/) to Jan
- Build AI applications without cloud dependencies
- Use both local and cloud models through the same API
- Maintain full privacy for local model interactions

## Key Features

**Local AI Models**
- Download popular open-source models (Llama, Gemma, Qwen) from Hugging Face
- Import any GGUF files from your computer
- Run models completely offline

**Cloud Integration**
- Connect to cloud services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq)
- Use your own API keys
- Switch between local and cloud models seamlessly

**Developer-Friendly**
- OpenAI-compatible API for easy integration
- Chat interface for testing and configuration
- Model parameter customization

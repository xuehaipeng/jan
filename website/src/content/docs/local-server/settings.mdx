# Settings

Access Jan's settings by clicking the Settings icon in the bottom left corner.

## Managing AI Models

Find all model options at **Settings** > **Model Providers**:

### Adding Models

**From Hugging Face:**
- Enter a model's ID (like `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`) in the search bar
- **Need authentication?** Some models require a Hugging Face token - add yours at **Settings > Model Providers > Hugging Face Access Token**

**From Your Computer:**
- Click **Import Model** and select GGUF files from your computer
- Works with any compatible model files you've downloaded

### Managing Existing Models

**Start a model:**
1. Open a new chat and select the model you want
2. Or go to **Settings > Model Providers** and click the **Start** button

**Remove a model:**
- Click the trash icon next to the **Start** button
- Confirm deletion when prompted

### Hugging Face Token Setup

For restricted models (like Meta's Llama models):
1. Get your token from [Hugging Face Tokens](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens)
2. Add it at **Settings > Model Providers > Hugging Face**

## Model Configuration (Gear Icon)

![Model Settings](../../../assets/trouble-shooting-04.png)

Click the gear icon next to any model to adjust how it behaves:

**Basic Settings:**
- **Context Size**: How much conversation history the model remembers
- **GPU Layers**: How much of the model runs on your graphics card (higher = faster, but uses more GPU memory)
- **Temperature**: Controls creativity (0.1 = focused, 1.0 = creative)

**Advanced Controls:**
- **Top K & Top P**: Fine-tune how the model picks words (lower = more focused)
- **Min P**: Minimum probability threshold for word selection
- **Repeat Penalty**: Prevents the model from repeating itself too much
- **Presence Penalty**: Encourages the model to use varied vocabulary

<Aside type="note">
For detailed explanations of these parameters, see our [Model Parameters Guide](/docs/model-parameters).
</Aside>

## Hardware Monitoring

Check your computer's performance at **Settings** > **Hardware**:

- **CPU, RAM, GPU**: Real-time usage and specifications
- **GPU Acceleration**: Turn GPU acceleration on/off
- **Temperature monitoring**: Keep an eye on system heat

<Aside type="caution">
If your computer gets very hot, consider using smaller models or reducing GPU layers.
</Aside>

## Personalization

This includes configuration for:
- Server Host and Port

## Your AI, Everywhere

Jan Mobile brings the full power of a private, local-first AI to your iOS and Android devices. Connect to your home desktop, your company's server, or run models directly on your phone for complete offline privacy.

The goal is a seamless experience that adapts to your environment without requiring you to change settings.

### Core Features Planned:

- **Offline Capability**: Run `Jan Nano` or other small models directly on your device.
- **Voice-First Interface**: Interact with your AI naturally through voice commands.
- **Privacy by Design**: End-to-end encryption and full control over your data.

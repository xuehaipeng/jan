# Best Settings to Run Qwen3-30B-A3B Locally

If you're running Qwen3-30B-A3B locally, don't guess your way through the settings. This guide tells you what actually works based on Qwen's own documentation and what we've seen hold up in practice.

<Aside type="tip">
**Quick Summary:**
- Qwen3-30B-A3B has two modes: thinking and non-thinking
- Each mode needs different generation settings
- Greedy decoding breaks thinking mode - avoid it
- Don't log &lt;think&gt; blocks in chat history
</Aside>

Qwen3 comes with a unique toggle: `enable_thinking`. When it's on, the model "thinks", it breaks down problems, reasons step-by-step, and wraps part of its output in a `<think>...</think>` block. When it's off, the model skips all that and just gives you an answer.

That changes how you configure it.

### Thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`)

This is the mode for reasoning, math, coding, logic — anything that benefits from step-by-step generation.

**Use these generation settings:**

```
Temperature: 0.6
TopP: 0.95
TopK: 20
Max tokens: 32,768
Do not use greedy decoding
```

 <Aside type="note">
**Why it matters:**
Thinking mode is powerful, but greedy decoding kills its output. It'll repeat or get stuck. Stick to sampling, and give it enough token space to finish its thoughts.
</Aside>


## Quick summary

### Non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`)

This is for fast, general-purpose replies. Instruction following, chat, creative writing — no `<think>` block, no extra steps.

**Use these settings:**

```makefile
Temperature: 0.7
TopP: 0.8
TopK: 20
```

 <Aside type="note">
Non-thinking mode is faster and more efficient, so the default token length is usually enough. If you're not doing long-form tasks, don't worry about it.
</Aside>



## Soft vs. hard switch

You can toggle thinking dynamically in the prompt using:

```
/think   # turns thinking ON
/no_think  # turns it OFF
```

This works only if `enable_thinking=True` is set in the code. If you set it to False, the soft switch won't do anything.



### What most people miss

- **Don't log the `think` block in chat history.** Qwen recommends keeping only the final answer. Otherwise, the next reply gets bloated and off-topic.
- **Greedy decoding is a trap.** It's tempting to use for consistency, but Qwen3's output gets worse - and sometimes broken - without sampling.
- **YaRN isn't always needed.** The model supports up to 32k context by default. Use YaRN only if you regularly go beyond that.

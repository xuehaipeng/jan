## Available Cohere Models

Jan automatically includes Cohere's available models. In case you want to use a specific
Cohere model that you cannot find in **Jan**, follow instructions in [Add Cloud Models](/docs/manage-models):
- See list of available models in [Cohere Documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list. For example, `command-nightly` or `command-light`.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your Cohere account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Cohere's [system status](https://status.cohere.com/)
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your Cohere account has the necessary permissions

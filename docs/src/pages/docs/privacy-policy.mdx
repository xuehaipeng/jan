## Introduction

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have control over your data. This Privacy Policy outlines what information Menlo Research Pte Ltd (the "Company") collects from users of the Jan desktop app and website (the "Services"), how the Company uses that information, and the measures the Company takes to safeguard that information.

## 1. Data Collection and Consent

### Explicit Consent

The Company does not collect any data until you explicitly allow tracking.

### Tracking Preferences

Upon first launching the Jan desktop app or visiting the website, you will be prompted to set your tracking preferences. These preferences can be modified at any time via the app's Settings menu or the website's Privacy Settings.

### Legal Basis

Pursuant to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the "GDPR"), the Company processes data based on your explicit consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a)). This means:

- The Company only processes your data after receiving clear, affirmative consent from you.
- You may withdraw your consent at any time through the app's Settings menu or the website's Privacy Settings.
- If you withdraw your consent, the Company will stop optional data collection from the effective date of withdrawal.
- Your withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing before its withdrawal.

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect

Regardless of your analytics permissions, the Company does not collect the following:

- Chat History: Your conversations with the Jan app are private and inaccessible to the Company.
- Chat Settings: Your personalized settings remain solely with you.
- Language Models: The specific language models you use are not tracked.

## 3. Uses of Information

To build a reliable and user-friendly product offering, understanding how the Jan app is used is essential. If you permit tracking, the Company collects product analytics data to:

- Improve User Experience: Enhance app functionality based on usage patterns; and

## 4. Product Analytics

### Data Collected

When you opt-in to tracking, we collect the following anonymous data:

- Active Users: Number of daily active users to gauge engagement.

### Data Anonymity

## 6. Using Cloud Models

The Jan app allows you to connect to cloud-based model APIs (e.g. GPT, Claude models).

- Data Handling: The API provider processes your messages directly; the Jan app does not access or store these messages.
- Local Models: Choosing local models ensures all data remains on your device, with no external access.

## 7. Data Storage and Processing

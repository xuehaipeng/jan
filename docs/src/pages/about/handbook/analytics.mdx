# Analytics

Adhering to Jan's privacy preserving philosophy, our analytics philosophy is to get "barely-enough-to-function'.

## What is tracked

1. By default, Github tracks downloads and device metadata for all public GitHub repositories. This helps us troubleshoot & ensure cross-platform support.
2. Additionally, we plan to enable a `Settings` feature for users to turn off all tracking.

### When you voluntarily provide data

We -do- collect personal information you voluntarily provide us, e.g., when you sign up for our newsletter, join our

### Jan

Jan runs with privacy by default and is used 100% offline on your own computer. Your data (e.g., conversation history,
usage logs) are stored locally and never leave your computer.

If you use a Remote AI API (e.g., OpenAI API, Groq API), your data will naturally travel to their servers. They will be
subject to the privacy policy of the respective API provider.
